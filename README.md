#### Welcome to the University of Code - Testing Guide!

Firstly if you are a part of the University of Code then make sure to check this repository for a starter template to get strated with practicing and testing all the challenge problems. Alternatively, you can also edit and run and test your code on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/university-of-code-testing-starter-project?file=functions.test.js). This will help you practice your own solutions for each problem and test if they pass all the test cases that are provided with each problem. Happy Coding!
